  Witch-Burning

  By MARY ELIZABETH COUNSELMAN


  They burned a witch in Bingham Square
    Last Friday afternoon.
  The faggot-smoke was blacker than
    The shadows on the moon;
  The licking flames were strangely green
    Like fox-fire on the fen ...
  And she who cursed the godly folk
    Will never curse again.

  They burned a witch in Bingham Square
    Before the village gate.
  A huswife raised a skinny hand
    To damn her, tense with hate.
  A huckster threw a jagged stone--
    Her pallid cheek ran red ...
  But there was something scornful in
    The way she held her head.

  They burned a witch in Bingham Square;
    Her eyes were terror-wild.
  She was a slight, a comely maid,
    No taller than a child.
  They bound her fast against the stake
    And laughed to see her fear ...
  Her red lips muttered secret words
    That no one dared to hear.

  They burned a witch in Bingham Square--
    But ere she swooned with pain
  And ere her bones were sodden ash
    Beneath the sudden rain,
  She set her mark upon that throng ...
    For time can not erase
  The echo of her anguished cries,
    The memory of her face.
